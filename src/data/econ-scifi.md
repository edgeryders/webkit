## The economy, different

We are the Sci-Fi Economics Lab. Inspired by science fiction, we nurture and support new, radical ways to think about the economy and economic policy.

<Text style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.3); color: black;">

Economists, politicians and business leaders, it seems, have given up on trying to imagine completely different economic systems. But we have not. And neither has a small group of brainy, visionary science fiction authors: Cory Doctorow (peer production and abundance in _Walkaway_ ), Bruce Sterling (nomads + cheap open source technology + reputation servers in _Distraction_ ), Neal Stephenson (phyla in _The Diamond Age_ ), Peter Watts (tons of insights from biology in the _Rifters_ trilogy), and others. We organize a meeting of minds where we can learn from each other what future economies might look like. And maybe even how we can help bring them into the world.

## The Long-Termism Deep Demonstration

<Text>

We are part of the Deep Demonstration on Long-Termism. This is an initiative by [EIT Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/programmes/deep-demonstrations/long-termism/publications/), aimed at showing what a long-term thinking society (and economy) could look like.

## Finding the viable mutants

<Text>

We are on the lookout for "viable mutants": economic models different from your usual late-stage capitalism, that can nevertheless survive and thrive in a late-stage capitalist economy. We wish to study them, and understand if they can be building blocks for a more humane economy.

This study is highly participatory. You can take part in it by engaging in discussion on our forum, and participating in our series of webinars.
