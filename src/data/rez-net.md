<Content id="about">

<Text>

We are a not-for-profit community-driven research institute. We are incorporated as an Estonian private limited company; maintain offices in Brussels and Stockholm; and operate globally. We use unique community-building tools and research techniques to detect and enhance citizen innovation, in response to key societal, economic, ecological and political challenges.

We aspire to bring the citizenry’s collective intelligence to contribute to a more grounded public policy. Over the years, we have engaged and connected many individuals in an online forum with about 6,000 registered user and 70,000 posts. Besides their scientific output, our research projects tend to bring about real-world impact, as they inspire initiatives by the respective communities. We are especially interested in regional economic development, citizen engagement, participatory culture, citizen science, transitions to a low-carbon economy, social innovation and societal resilience.
