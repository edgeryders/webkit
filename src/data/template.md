# About

We want to secure resilient lives and livelihoods for us the 99.999%, especially in the face of systemic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and the ever-advancing climate crisis. To that end, this program is a series of activities aimed at discovering and co-creating experimental new social, economic and business models. A reframing of livelihood generation from a lonely, competitive activity, to one that is collaborative, sustainable and accessible to all. The perfect time and place to 'find the others', and grow personally, professionally and socially.
